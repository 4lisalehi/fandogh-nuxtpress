# fandogh-nuxtpress
My first Nuxt.js project in which I've used WordPress Rest API.
Using axios I retrieve JSON of posts & comments of WPTarven blog and render it to the user using Vue.js.

Currently the project includes Three main pages:

    1. Home Page: Nothing but Nuxt.js default layout and nuxt links to comments & posts.
    2. Posts: WPTavern blog posts, Which is routed to /posts.
    3. Comments: WPTavern users' comments, routed to /comments.
